# ARKit & RealityKit Learning Journey

Welcome to my ARKit & RealityKit Learning Journey! This repository is my personal space to document the learning process, challenges, and achievements as I explore the capabilities of ARKit and RealityKit. My goal is to build a comprehensive guide that not only reflects my growth in augmented reality development but also serves as a resource for fellow learners.

## About ARKit & RealityKit

ARKit and RealityKit are powerful frameworks provided by Apple for augmented reality development on iOS devices. ARKit enables developers to create high-quality AR experiences, incorporating features like face tracking, motion capture, and environmental understanding. RealityKit, on the other hand, is designed to work seamlessly with ARKit, providing a more realistic rendering and physics for AR objects.

## Objectives

- **Learn and Master ARKit**: Dive deep into ARKit's features, from basic setup to advanced functionalities.
- **Explore RealityKit**: Understand how RealityKit complements ARKit and how to use it for creating immersive AR experiences.
- **Build Projects**: Apply what I've learned in practical projects, documenting the process, challenges, and solutions.
- **Share Knowledge**: Provide insights, tutorials, and code snippets to help others in their AR development journey.
